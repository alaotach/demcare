- Implement role-based access control (Doctor, Caregiver, Family Member, Physician)
- Use React Navigation for routing

## Key Features
- Authentication with role-based access
- Doctor dashboard with patient management
- Real-time vital signs monitoring (Heart Rate, SpOâ‚‚, Respiratory Rate, Step Count)
- Live camera feed integration
- QR/MAC address scanning for device pairing
- Subscription management (Free, Premium, Enterprise)
- Dark/Light mode support
- Push notifications for alerts
